# Apply rules to entire workspaces. 
# Use `hyprctl monitors all` to find monitor names.

# --- Assign Workspaces to Specific Monitors ---
# IMPORTANT: Replace 'DP-1' with the actual name of your second monitor!
# You can find the name by running `hyprctl monitors all` in a terminal.
# If you only have one monitor, these rules will be ignored.
workspace = 6, monitor:DP-1, persistent:true # Assign Workspace 6 to DP-1 (Example)
workspace = 7, monitor:DP-1, persistent:true # Assign Workspace 7 to DP-1 (Example)
workspace = 8, monitor:DP-1, persistent:true # Assign Workspace 8 to DP-1 (Example)
workspace = 9, monitor:DP-1, persistent:true # Assign Workspace 9 to DP-1 (Example)
workspace = 10, monitor:DP-1, persistent:true # Assign Workspace 10 to DP-1 (Example)

# --- Special Workspace Settings ---
# Example: Workspace 3: No gaps, borders, or rounding for a distraction-free environment
# workspace = 3, gapsin:0, gapsout:0, border:false, rounding:false, decorate:false [14]

# Example: Assign workspace "main" as the default for monitor eDP-1
# workspace = name:main, monitor:eDP-1, default:true [14]

# Example: Run a script when workspace "scratch" is created empty
# workspace = name:scratch, on-created-empty:exec ~/.config/hypr/scripts/setup_scratchpad.sh [14]
