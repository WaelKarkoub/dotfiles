# Configure your monitors here.
# Use `hyprctl monitors all` to find monitor names/descriptions.
# Remember: Position calculations use SCALED resolution. [5]
# The Y-axis is inverted (negative Y is up). [5, 6]

# Example: Laptop screen (eDP-1) at 1.5x scale, External 4K (DP-1) at 2x scale to the right
# monitor=eDP-1, 2880x1800@90, 0x0, 1.5
# monitor=DP-1, 3840x2160@60, 1920x0, 2 # Position uses scaled width of eDP-1 (2880 / 1.5 = 1920)

# Example: Preferred ettings, auto-positioning, auto-scaling
monitor=,preferred,auto,auto

# Fallback for any other connected monitor (e.g., docking)
monitor=,preferred,auto-right,1

# Reserve space at the top for Waybar (adjust value based on your Waybar height)
# monitor=,addreserved,30,0,0,0
