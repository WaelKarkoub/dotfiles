#: Fonts {{{

#: kitty has very powerful font management. You can configure
#: individual font faces and even specify special fonts for particular
#: characters.

#: You can specify different fonts for the bold/italic/bold-italic
#: variants. To get a full list of supported fonts use the `kitty
#: list-fonts` command. By default they are derived automatically, by
#: the OSes font system. Setting them manually is useful for font
#: families that have many weight variants like Book, Medium, Thick,
#: etc. For example::

font_family      JetBrains Mono Medium
bold_font        JetBrains Mono Bold
italic_font      JetBrains Mono Italic
bold_italic_font JetBrains Mono Bold Italic

font_size 11.0
